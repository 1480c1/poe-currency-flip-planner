** DONE Scrape HTML from poe.trade
   CLOSED: [2017-12-29 Fri 02:43]
*** conversion rate
*** seller IGN
*** maximum stock
** DONE Build a graph for given set of currencies and conversion rates
   CLOSED: [2018-01-14 Sun 18:34]
*** What to do with offers with same conversion rates?
** DONE Implement graph traversal => paths
   CLOSED: [2018-01-14 Sun 18:34]
** DONE Transform paths in actual feasible transactions 
   CLOSED: [2018-02-21 Wed 23:10]
*** DONE Build list of transactions "n of currency x for m of currency y" 
    CLOSED: [2018-01-27 Sat 00:45]
*** DONE Step 1a: Calculate maximum gainable amount of only the target currency 
    CLOSED: [2018-01-27 Sat 00:45]
** DONE Handle different contingents correctly 
   CLOSED: [2018-02-01 Thu 23:05]
** DONE Review current functionality
   CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
*** DONE fetch offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE parse offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE build graph from parsed offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE build paths
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:41]
*** DONE evaluate paths
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
**** profitability check for each path -> prune paths
**** detect maximum flow for each path -> alter paths to make sense
*** DONE filter sort result winning paths by length and winnings
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
** DONE [#A] Parallelize http requests to poe.trade
   CLOSED: [2018-04-19 Thu 20:52]
** TODO [#B] Incorporate NPC trading ratios (unlimited stock)
*** https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Currency#Vendor_prices_chart
*** Master Progression: limited stock
*** Main + Scraps Progression: unlimited stock
** DONE [#A] Try to filter out impossibly good trades by (eg. 1 Chromatics -> 2 Chaos)
   CLOSED: [2018-04-17 Tue 21:09]
*** Maybe introduce some tier hierarchy for currencies
*** Currencies of Tier 1 should always cost more than Tier 2 currencies
*** If the conversion rate suggests otherwise, filter out that graph edge
** TODO [#A] Make sure no "paid: 0" paths are possible
** TODO [#B] Do some analysis of the possible trades in the winning graph
*** eg. how many trades per currency are possible that could earn winnings
*** per currency, how big are possible winnings
*** what non-target currencies are most often part of trade chains
** TODO [#B] Add end-user functionality to easily scan conversion rates for a given currency and league, sorted by descending profitability 
*** Especially for scaling down starting payments
** TODO [#B] Try to incorporate remainders of other currencies (due to the different contingents) in the efficiency comparison

* Todo List
** DONE Scrape HTML from poe.trade
   CLOSED: [2017-12-29 Fri 02:43]
*** conversion rate
*** seller IGN
*** maximum stock
** DONE Build a graph for given set of currencies and conversion rates
   CLOSED: [2018-01-14 Sun 18:34]
*** What to do with offers with same conversion rates?
** DONE Implement graph traversal => paths
   CLOSED: [2018-01-14 Sun 18:34]
** DONE Transform paths in actual feasible transactions
   CLOSED: [2018-02-21 Wed 23:10]
*** DONE Build list of transactions "n of currency x for m of currency y"
    CLOSED: [2018-01-27 Sat 00:45]
*** DONE Step 1a: Calculate maximum gainable amount of only the target currency
    CLOSED: [2018-01-27 Sat 00:45]
** DONE Handle different contingents correctly
   CLOSED: [2018-02-01 Thu 23:05]
** DONE Review current functionality
   CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
*** DONE fetch offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE parse offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE build graph from parsed offers
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:18]
*** DONE build paths
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:41]
*** DONE evaluate paths
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
**** profitability check for each path -> prune paths
**** detect maximum flow for each path -> alter paths to make sense
*** DONE filter sort result winning paths by length and winnings
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 15:58]
** DONE Parallelize http requests to poe.trade
   CLOSED: [2018-04-19 Thu 20:52]
** DONE Try to filter out impossibly good trades by (eg. 1 Chromatics -> 2 Chaos)
   CLOSED: [2018-04-17 Tue 21:09]
*** Maybe introduce some tier hierarchy for currencies
*** Currencies of Tier 1 should always cost more than Tier 2 currencies
*** If the conversion rate suggests otherwise, filter out that graph edge
** DONE Make sure no "paid: 0" paths are possible
   CLOSED: [2018-04-20 Fri 22:58]
** DONE Rewrite data fetching to use pathofexile.com/trade instead of poe.trade
   CLOSED: [2018-07-21 Sat 14:51]
*** DONE Add backend-specific tests
    CLOSED: [2018-07-21 Sat 14:51]
*** Should yield a very nice performance boost
** DONE [#B] Do some analysis of the possible trades in the graph
** TODO [#A] Add end-user functionality to easily scan conversion rates for a given currency and league, sorted by descending profitability
*** DONE [#A] Add cli interface for finding profitable conversions for a given currency
   CLOSED: [2018-12-11 Tue 00:41]
*** DONE Build data collector that regularly serializes the Pathfinder results
    CLOSED: [2018-05-12 Sat 17:07]
*** Analyze collected results
**** DONE Number of profitable conversions over time
     CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 15:23]
**** DONE Importance of currency routes in profitable conversions (Heatmap)
     CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 13:32]
**** DONE Number of profitable conversions per starting currency over time
     CLOSED: [2018-12-11 Tue 00:40]
** TODO [#B] Improve Performance
*** Parallelize graph traversal
**** As of now, this is not needed, as the graphs are traversed fast enough, ~1s
*** DONE [#B] Avoid poeofficial backend rate limit
    CLOSED: [2018-07-21 Sat 18:02]
** TODO [#C] Try to incorporate remainders of other currencies (due to the different contingents) in the efficiency comparison
** TODO [#A] Benchmark poe.trade req/s performance
  Depending on how strong the speedup compared to poeofficial is, it might be worth it to invest time to find a solution to the price-fixing filterting issue
** TODO [#C] Incorporate NPC trading ratios (unlimited stock)
